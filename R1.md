## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode - will done in 2018

### Day 1 : May 1, Tuesday

**Today's Desired Progress:** Spent time to learn Docker Network.

**Thoughts:** Today i learn about Docker Network, I'm stucking in Overlay driver and Docker-machine, i want to learn about how Docker communicate to host's interface network.

**Link to work:** https://docs.docker.com/network/overlay/ ,  https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part4/#create-a-cluster , https://docs.docker.com/network/network-tutorial-overlay/#prerequisites-1

### Day 2 : May 2, Wednesday

**Thoughts:** Today i pass counting-sheep-kata in codewar. I haven't finished docker network -_-. Although i learn alot with my viblo, i have to rewrite it -_-. That's unfair. May be i'll finish Docker network in weekend.

Desired progress: Block chain knowledge
